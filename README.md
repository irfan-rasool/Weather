# Important notes:

#### What is middleware?
Middleware are functions that take an action and depends upon actions type or payload or any other params. The middleware let action pass through. It can manipulate action or stop all together before they reach reducers. 
So in other terms they are kind of gatekeepers before actions goes to reducers.
